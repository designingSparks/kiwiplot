# Pretty Plot
Pretty plot is a thin wrapper built on top of the fast pyqtgraph library that provides aesthetically pleasing, styleable graphs out of the box.


## Motivation
Pretty Plot was originally developed to address some of the visual shortcomings that the author encountered when using the pyqtgraph package. Pyqtgraph is a fast graphing library that is based on QT. However, it was designed for speed rather than aesthetics. 

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- pyqtgraph 0.12+
- PySide2 or PyQt5
- numpy 1.17+
